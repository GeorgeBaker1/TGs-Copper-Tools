Note to self: revamp README later. DO NOT FORGET!


This is The Georginator's Copper Tools mod! 

I made this mod because I was unhappy with other copper tools mods, and how they worked. 

These tools have stats *between* stone and iron, instead of being at iron's mining level, and weaker, or stone's mining level, and better, etc.

These copper tools are required to mine iron, so don't break it with a stone tool!
