Note to self: revamp README later. DO NOT FORGET!


This is The Georginator's Copper Tools mod! 

I made this mod because I was unhappy with other copper tools mods, and how they worked. 

These tools have stats *between* stone and iron, instead of being at iron's mining level but weaker, or stone's mining level but stronger, etc.

These copper tools ~~are~~ will be(when I figure that out) required to mine iron, so don't break it with a stone tool!
