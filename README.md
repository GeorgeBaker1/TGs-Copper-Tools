Note to self: revamp README later. DO NOT FORGET!


This is The Georginator's Copper Tools mod! 

I made this mod because I was unhappy with other copper tools mods, and how they worked. 

These tools have stats *between* stone and iron, instead of being at iron's mining level but weaker, or stone's mining level but stronger, etc.

These copper tools are required to mine iron, so don't break it with a stone tool!

Crafting recipes are the same as any other tool, using copper ingots.
